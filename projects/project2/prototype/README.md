# Plural platformers

##Artist's statement

###Game Design

This is a modified version of a basic platformer: You are controlling multiple characters at the same time! and most of the time they have mirrored movements (vertically flipped, horizontally flipped or BOTH)! The player has to navigate through all the environmental obstacles to reach their goals, making this game more of a puzzle game than a conventional platformer.

Unlike most platformers, you don't necessarily need fast motor reflex: since there's no timer or any moving obstacles. However, it challenges the player's hand-eye coordination: moving and jumping with precision is often required.

Most important of all - Puzzle solving is the main challenge: since there's multiple avatars moving simultaneous under the player's control, making sure that all points are collected while no avatar dies can be hard. There is usually a specific solution to each level, in form of doing actions in a specific sequence- wrong order of your movements can lead to failing the level.


###Visual Design

Since my main focus was the level design - I decided to keep the art simple. (for example, the bunnies not turning to face the direction it's heading is a design choice meant to give further visual indication of which type of movement it has).

If more time was given I would probably make the UI better ;w;


###Sound design

All sounds and music were made with Ableton Live. same as the visuals, I decided to make something simple.
